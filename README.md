# fCC_Relational-Database
Here are some of my Relational Database Projects on freeCodeCamp

## Celestial Bodies Database - Stage 01
- **Introduction**: This is my first time doing PRJ on virtual machine. I had a lot of trouble with the error saving the SQL file so I had to write it twice. But luckily it passed, great experience! XD.
- **Skills**: SQL, Virtual Machine, Linux, PostgreSQL, ERD.
- **Purposes**: View data about celestial bodies.

## World Cup Database - Stage 02
- **Introduction**: I'm really surprised about the bash file able to automate. Just running a single file gives me the entire database.
- **Skills**: Virtual Machine, Linux, PostgreSQL, Bash Script, Automation.
